## Dialog Flow Enhancement

### Complete Conversation Trees

### Variable Integration
- `bandit_quest_accepted`: Tracks quest acceptance
- `trial_quest_given`: Tracks trial quest status  
- `knows_trials`: Knowledge flag for trial information
- `elder_trust`: Relationship progression (0-4 scale)

### Branching Logic
Each new node provides meaningful choices that:
- Lead to other conversation topics
- Offer quest opportunities
- Provide world-building information
- Allow natural conversation endings

## Testing
- ✅ JSON syntax validation passed
- ✅ Dialog system loads without errors
- ✅ All referenced nodes now exist
- ✅ Conversation paths complete successfully

## Result

- **19 total dialog nodes** (was 12, added 9)
- **Multiple quest paths** for different player approaches
- **Rich world-building** content
- **Meaningful character progression** through trust system
