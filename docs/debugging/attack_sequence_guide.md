# Combat Attack Sequence - Step by Step Guide

## 🎯 The Problem You Encountered

Based on your log analysis, here's exactly what happened:

### **What You Experienced:**
1. ✅ You clicked the **Attack** button
2. ❌ You saw "selecting attack" but nothing happened when you clicked enemies
3. ❌ No feedback about why the attack didn't work

### **Root Cause:**
- **Units were 13+ tiles apart** (attack range is only 1 tile)
- **UI allowed attack selection even with no valid targets**
- **No feedback when clicking on out-of-range enemies**

## ✅ Fixed Attack Sequence (How It Works Now)

### **Step 1: Check Your Position** 
- Look at your unit's position relative to enemies
- **Attack range = 1 tile only** (must be directly adjacent)
- If enemies are far away, you'll need to move first

### **Step 2: Move Close to Enemy (If Needed)**
```
🚶 Click "Move" button
🎯 Click on a tile near an enemy (within your movement range)  
✅ Your unit moves to that position
```

### **Step 3: Attack When Adjacent**
```
⚔️  Click "Attack" button
   → If enemies in range: "🎯 Select an enemy to attack (found X targets)"
   → If no enemies in range: "❌ No enemies in attack range! Move closer to an enemy first."
🎯 Click on highlighted enemy (red highlighting)
🗡️  "Attacking Enemy_5!" → Attack executes
```

## 🆕 Improved User Feedback

### **Attack Button Behavior:**
| Situation | Button State | What Happens When Clicked |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Enemies in range** | ✅ Enabled | Enters target selection mode |
| **No enemies in range** | ❌ Disabled | Shows helpful error message |
| **Insufficient AP** | ❌ Disabled | Button appears grayed out |

### **Console Messages:**
```bash
# When no enemies in range:
❌ No enemies in attack range! Move closer to an enemy first.
💡 Tip: Use the Move button to get within 1 tile of an enemy

# When enemies are in range:  
🎯 Select an enemy to attack (found 2 targets)

# When you successfully attack:
🗡️  Attacking Enemy_5!

# When you click wrong spot in attack mode:
❌ Click on a highlighted enemy to attack (found 2 valid targets)
```

### **Visual Feedback:**
- **🟦 Blue highlighting**: Valid movement positions
- **🟥 Red highlighting**: Valid attack targets  
- **💭 Tooltips**: Hover over disabled attack button for explanation

## 📋 Complete Combat Sequence

### **Optimal Turn Flow:**
```
Turn 1: 🚶 Move → Get closer to enemies
Turn 2: 🚶 Move → Get adjacent to target (1 tile away)
Turn 3: ⚔️  Attack → Click enemy → 💥 Damage dealt!
```

### **Action Point Management:**
- **Movement**: Costs AP based on distance
- **Attack**: Costs 1 AP (must be adjacent)
- **End Turn**: Spends all remaining AP

## 🎮 Testing the Fixes

### **What You Should See Now:**

#### **Scenario 1: Enemies Too Far (Most Common)**
```
1. Click "Attack" button
2. Console: "❌ No enemies in attack range! Move closer to an enemy first."
3. Console: "💡 Tip: Use the Move button to get within 1 tile of an enemy"
4. UI stays in action selection (doesn't enter attack mode)
5. Use Move button to get closer!
```

#### **Scenario 2: Enemy Adjacent (Ready to Attack)**
```
1. Click "Attack" button  
2. Console: "🎯 Select an enemy to attack (found 1 targets)"
3. Enemy highlights in red
4. Click the highlighted enemy
5. Console: "🗡️ Attacking Enemy_5!"
6. Attack animation and damage calculation occurs
```

#### **Scenario 3: In Attack Mode but Click Wrong Spot**
```
1. You're in attack target selection mode
2. Click on empty tile or wrong enemy
3. Console: "❌ Click on a highlighted enemy to attack (found 1 valid targets)"
4. Try clicking the red-highlighted enemy instead
```

## 🔧 Technical Improvements Made

### **File: `/internal/ui/combat_ui.go`**

#### **1. Smart Attack Button Logic**
```go
// Only enter attack mode if valid targets exist
if len(cui.ValidAttackTargets) > 0 {
    cui.State = CombatUIStateSelectingAttackTarget
    fmt.Printf("🎯 Select an enemy to attack (found %d targets)\n", len(cui.ValidAttackTargets))
} else {
    fmt.Printf("❌ No enemies in attack range! Move closer to an enemy first.\n")
    cui.State = CombatUIStateSelectingAction // Stay in action selection
}
```

#### **2. Attack Target Validation**
```go
// Provide feedback when clicking in attack mode
if !targetFound && len(cui.ValidAttackTargets) > 0 {
    fmt.Printf("❌ Click on a highlighted enemy to attack\n")
} else if len(cui.ValidAttackTargets) == 0 {
    fmt.Printf("❌ No valid attack targets! Move closer first.\n")
}
```

#### **3. Successful Attack Feedback** 
```go
fmt.Printf("🗡️ Attacking %s!\n", target.GetID())
```

## 🎯 Key Points to Remember

### **Attack Range Rules:**
- ⚔️  **Attack range = 1 tile only** (must be adjacent/diagonal)
- 🚶 **Move first** if enemies are far away  
- 🎯 **Red highlighting** shows valid attack targets
- ❌ **No highlighting = no valid targets**

### **UI States:**
- **"Selecting Action"**: Choose Move/Attack/Wait
- **"Selecting Attack Target"**: Only appears if enemies in range
- **Visual feedback**: Console messages guide you through the process

### **Debugging Tips:**
- Watch console output for helpful messages
- Check unit positions on the grid
- Remember attack requires adjacency (1 tile distance)
- Use Move action to position units strategically

## 🚀 Try It Now!

The combat system now provides clear guidance at every step. You should see immediate feedback about:

1. ✅ **Why attacks are disabled** (no enemies in range)
2. ✅ **When attacks are possible** (enemies adjacent)  
3. ✅ **How to fix positioning** (use Move button first)
4. ✅ **Successful attack confirmation** (attack executed)

Run the game and follow the console messages - they'll guide you through the correct sequence! 🎮
