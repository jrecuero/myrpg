# Column 0 Movement Fix - Final Implementation

## Problem Summary
Players could not move within column 0 (X=0) of the tactical grid due to persistent "Cannot move to occupied tile" errors, even when tiles appeared empty.

## Root Cause Identified
The issue was **grid state corruption** during tactical deployment and movement operations:

1. **Grid state not cleared** before tactical deployment
2. **Stale occupancy data** persisted from previous tactical encounters
3. **Inconsistent occupancy clearing** during player movement

## Final Solution Implemented

### âœ… Fix 1: Grid State Reset on Tactical Mode Entry
**File**: `internal/engine/engine.go` - `SwitchToTacticalMode()`

```go
// Clear grid occupancy state before deployment to ensure clean state
g.clearGridOccupancy()

// Deploy entities to tactical grid
g.tacticalDeployment.DeployParty(partyMembers)
g.tacticalDeployment.DeployEnemies(enemies)
```

**Purpose**: Ensures clean grid state every time tactical mode starts.

### âœ… Fix 2: Added Grid State Clearing Method
**File**: `internal/engine/engine.go`

```go
// clearGridOccupancy resets all grid tiles to unoccupied state
func (g *Game) clearGridOccupancy() {
    for x := 0; x < g.tacticalManager.Grid.Width; x++ {
        for z := 0; z < g.tacticalManager.Grid.Height; z++ {
            pos := tactical.GridPos{X: x, Z: z}
            g.tacticalManager.Grid.SetOccupied(pos, false, "")
        }
    }
}
```

**Purpose**: Systematically clears all tile occupancy across the entire grid.

### âœ… Fix 3: Improved Movement Validation
**File**: `internal/engine/engine.go` - `tryMovePlayerToTile()`

```go
// Clear old position - ensure we're clearing the right tile
oldTile := g.tacticalManager.Grid.GetTile(currentPos)
if oldTile != nil && oldTile.Occupied && oldTile.UnitID == player.GetID() {
    g.tacticalManager.Grid.SetOccupied(currentPos, false, "")
}
```

**Purpose**: Only clear occupancy if the tile is actually occupied by the moving player.

### âœ… Fix 4: Simplified Coordinate Conversion
**File**: `internal/engine/engine.go` - `worldToGridPos()`

```go
// worldToGridPos converts world coordinates to grid position - exact inverse of GridToWorld
func (g *Game) worldToGridPos(worldX, worldY float64) tactical.GridPos {
    offsetX, offsetY := 50.0, 120.0
    tileSize := float64(g.tacticalManager.Grid.TileSize)
    gridX := int((worldX - offsetX) / tileSize)
    gridZ := int((worldY - offsetY) / tileSize)
    return tactical.GridPos{X: gridX, Z: gridZ}
}
```

**Purpose**: Exact mathematical inverse of GridToWorld for consistent conversion.

## Technical Details

### Grid State Management Flow
```
1. Enter Tactical Mode
   â†“
2. clearGridOccupancy() - Reset all tiles
   â†“  
3. DeployParty() - Place party members
   â†“
4. DeployEnemies() - Place enemy units
   â†“
5. Movement Operations - Validated occupancy management
```

### Occupancy Validation Logic
```go
Before Movement:
- Check if target tile is passable
- Verify current position matches expected position

During Movement:  
- Clear old position only if occupied by moving unit
- Set new position with unit ID
- Update entity transform coordinates

Result:
- Clean grid state maintained
- No phantom occupancy
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### âœ… Column 0 Movement
- Players deployed at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), etc.
- Can move freely within column 0: (0,0) â†’ (0,1) â†’ (0,2)
- Can move from column 0 to other columns: (0,0) â†’ (1,0)
- Can move back to column 0: (1,0) â†’ (0,0)

### âœ… All Grid Movement
- No more "Cannot move to occupied tile" for valid moves
- Proper occupancy state maintained
- Multiple players can move independently
- Grid state resets cleanly between tactical encounters

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Column 0 Movement
1. Enter tactical mode (collide with enemy)
2. Select player in column 0 (use TAB if needed)
3. Use arrow keys to move within column 0
4. **Expected**: Movement works without errors

### Test Case 2: Cross-Column Movement  
1. Move player from column 0 to column 1
2. Move player back from column 1 to column 0
3. **Expected**: Both directions work smoothly

### Test Case 3: Multiple Tactical Encounters
1. Complete one tactical encounter (ESC to return to exploration)
2. Trigger another tactical encounter
3. **Expected**: Fresh grid state, no phantom occupancy

## Implementation Impact

### Performance
- **Minimal**: Grid clearing is O(width Ã— height) = O(300) for 20Ã—15 grid
- **Once per encounter**: Only runs when entering tactical mode
- **Negligible runtime cost**: Simple integer operations

### Compatibility
- âœ… **No breaking changes** to existing API
- âœ… **All existing features preserved**
- âœ… **Enhanced reliability** for grid-based movement

### Maintainability  
- âœ… **Clear separation of concerns**: Grid state management isolated
- âœ… **Robust error handling**: Validation before state changes
- âœ… **Debug-friendly**: Clear occupancy state reduces debugging complexity

## Summary

The column 0 movement issue was caused by stale grid occupancy data persisting between tactical encounters and inconsistent occupancy clearing during movement operations. 

**The fix implements:**
1. **Clean slate approach**: Reset grid state on each tactical encounter
2. **Defensive programming**: Validate occupancy before clearing
3. **Mathematical precision**: Exact coordinate conversion symmetry

**Result**: Players can now move freely in all grid columns, including column 0, with reliable grid state management. ðŸŽ¯âœ¨
