# Battle System Test Guide

## âœ… **Fixed Issues**

### 1. **Movement Disabled During Battle**
- **Problem**: Players could move and switch during battle selection
- **Solution**: All movement keys (arrows) and TAB key are now disabled when `battleSystem.IsInBattle()` returns true
- **Test**: Enter battle, try pressing arrow keys or TAB - nothing should happen

### 2. **Battle Menu Persistence** 
- **Problem**: Battle menu sometimes stayed on screen after attack
- **Solution**: Enhanced state management with stricter conditions for showing battle UI
- **Test**: Execute attacks with ENTER - menu should disappear immediately after selection

## ðŸŽ® **How to Test the Fixes**

### **Test Scenario 1: Movement Lock**
1. Start the game
2. Move player (Conan) toward an enemy (Goblin Scout or Orc Warrior)  
3. When battle menu appears, try:
   - **Arrow keys** â†’ Should NOT move player
   - **TAB key** â†’ Should NOT switch players
   - Only **1, 2, ESC, ENTER** should work

### **Test Scenario 2: Menu Clearing**
1. Trigger a battle by walking into an enemy
2. Select an attack type (1 or 2)
3. Press ENTER to execute
4. **Battle menu should disappear immediately**
5. Battle messages should appear in bottom panel
6. After enemy retaliation, battle ends and menu stays hidden

### **Test Scenario 3: Cancel Attack**
1. Start battle with enemy
2. Press ESC to select "Cancel" 
3. Press ENTER to confirm
4. Should see "Attack cancelled." message
5. Battle ends, menu disappears, player switches

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Changes Made**

### **Engine.go Updates:**
```go
// Update method now checks battle state first
func (g *Game) Update() error {
    g.battleSystem.Update()
    
    // ONLY handle input if NOT in battle  
    if !g.battleSystem.IsInBattle() {
        // TAB switching and movement here
    }
}
```

### **Battle.go Improvements:**
```go
// Stricter battle state checking
func (bs *BattleSystem) IsInBattle() bool {
    return bs.State == BattleStatePlayerTurn && 
           bs.UIVisible && 
           bs.CurrentPlayer != nil && 
           bs.CurrentEnemy != nil
}

// Enhanced menu text conditions
func (bs *BattleSystem) GetBattleMenuText() string {
    if bs.State != BattleStatePlayerTurn || !bs.UIVisible {
        return "" // Hide menu immediately when battle not active
    }
}
```

## ðŸš€ **Expected Behavior Now**

1. **Before Battle**: Normal movement with arrow keys, TAB switching works
2. **During Battle**: 
   - Movement keys completely disabled
   - TAB switching disabled
   - Only battle inputs (1, 2, ESC, ENTER) work
   - Battle menu clearly visible with selections
3. **Attack Execution**: 
   - Menu disappears immediately when ENTER pressed
   - Battle messages show damage calculations
   - Enemy retaliation occurs
4. **After Battle**: 
   - Menu completely hidden
   - Normal movement restored
   - Automatically switches to next player

The battle system now provides a much better user experience with proper input isolation during combat! ðŸŽ‰
