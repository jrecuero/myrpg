# Turn-Based Combat Manager Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Implementation

### **Core Combat Manager** (`internal/tactical/turn_based_combat.go`)

**Combat Phases:**
- `CombatPhaseInitialization` - Set up teams, AP, and initiative
- `CombatPhaseTeamTurn` - Handle team turns and player/AI decisions  
- `CombatPhaseActionExecution` - Execute and validate combat actions
- `CombatPhaseEndTurn` - Process end of turn effects
- `CombatPhaseVictoryCheck` - Check win/loss conditions
- `CombatPhaseEnded` - Combat finished

**Team Management:**
- Automatic team creation based on entity tags (Player/Enemy)
- Initiative calculation using total team speed (sum of all member speeds)
- Turn order management with round progression

**Action Point System:**
- AP allocation by job class (Warrior: 4, Mage: 3, Rogue: 5, Cleric: 4, Archer: 4)
- AP costs per action (Move: 1, Attack: 2, Item: 1, EndTurn: 0)
- AP restoration at start of each team turn

**Combat Actions:**
- Attack validation (adjacent tiles only, range = 1)
- Damage calculation (Attack - Defense, minimum 1)
- Death detection and victory condition checking
- Message logging for all combat events

**Enemy AI:**
- Simple adjacency-based attack behavior
- Automatic turn completion when no actions available
- No enemy movement (as specified in design)

### **ECS Integration** (`internal/ecs/components/combat.go`)

**New Components:**
- `ActionPointsComponent` - Current/Maximum AP with utility methods
- `CombatStateComponent` - Team, Initiative, HasActed, IsActive flags
- Team enum (TeamPlayer, TeamEnemy)

**Entity Accessor Methods:**
- `entity.ActionPoints()` - Get ActionPointsComponent
- `entity.CombatState()` - Get CombatStateComponent
- Component constants added to ECS system

### **Tactical Manager Integration** (`internal/engine/tactical_manager.go`)

**Enhanced TacticalManager:**
- Added `TurnBasedCombat` field alongside legacy `Combat` system
- `UseTurnBasedCombat` flag for system switching
- Integrated initialization and update loops
- Combat end handling with result processing

**Game Engine Integration:**
- Message callback wired to UI system
- Update loop integrated into main game loop
- Backward compatibility maintained with existing tactical system

### **Constants System** (`internal/constants/game.go`)

**Action Point Constants:**
- Job-specific max AP values
- Action cost definitions
- Centralized configuration for easy balancing

## ðŸŽ¯ **Design Specification Compliance**

âœ… **Initiative System**: Team with highest total speed goes first  
âœ… **Action Points Economy**: Free-form spending, job-specific maximums  
âœ… **Adjacent Combat**: Range=1 attacks with target validation  
âœ… **Death Handling**: HPâ‰¤0 detection and unit removal logic  
âœ… **Enemy AI**: Simple adjacent attack behavior (no movement)  
âœ… **Base Stats**: Attack-Defense damage calculation  
âœ… **Team Turns**: All team members act within single team turn  

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Architecture**

**Combat Flow:**
```
1. Initialize Combat â†’ Add Components â†’ Create Teams â†’ Calculate Initiative
2. Team Turn â†’ Restore AP â†’ Process Actions (Player Input/AI)
3. Action Execution â†’ Validate â†’ Execute â†’ Consume AP
4. Victory Check â†’ Continue or End Combat
5. Next Team Turn â†’ Repeat until Victory/Defeat
```

**Integration Points:**
- **UI Callbacks**: Messages sent to UIManager via callback
- **Grid System**: Uses existing Grid for positioning and adjacency
- **ECS Components**: Seamlessly integrated with existing RPGStats
- **Game Loop**: Updates called from main engine update cycle

## ðŸš§ **Next Steps for Full Implementation**

### **1. Movement Execution** (High Priority)
- Implement `executeMovement()` method in combat manager
- Grid position updates with occupancy tracking
- AP consumption per tile moved
- Visual feedback for movement

### **2. UI Integration** (High Priority)  
- Combat phase indicators in UI
- Active team display
- AP remaining display
- Action selection interface (Move/Attack/EndTurn buttons)

### **3. Player Action Input** (High Priority)
- Mouse/keyboard input for action selection
- Target selection UI for attacks
- Movement tile selection with range highlighting
- Turn end confirmation

### **4. Enhanced Features** (Medium Priority)
- Equipment modifiers for damage calculation
- Status effects system
- Attack ranges beyond adjacent tiles
- Visual combat animations

## ðŸ“Š **Current Status**

**âœ… Fully Implemented:**
- Core combat manager with all phases
- Team-based initiative system  
- Action point economy
- Basic attack resolution
- Enemy AI behavior
- ECS component integration
- Tactical manager integration

**ðŸ”„ In Progress:**
- Movement action execution
- Player input handling  
- UI combat interface

**ðŸ“‹ Ready for Testing:**
The combat manager is architecturally complete and ready for integration testing. All core systems (initiative, teams, AP, attacks, AI) are functional and await UI/input implementation to become fully playable.
