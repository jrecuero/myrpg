# Party System Issues - Fixed Implementation

## Summary of Issues Addressed

You reported three main issues with the party management system:

1. **Multiple players showing in exploration mode** - Only party leader should be visible
2. **Players/enemies positioned at top in tactical mode** - Should be properly positioned on grid
3. **No movement/player switching in tactical mode** - Missing tactical input handling

## âœ… Issue 1: Hide Non-Leader Party Members in Exploration Mode

### Problem
All party members were being rendered in exploration mode, when only the party leader should be visible.

### Solution
**File**: `internal/engine/engine.go` - `Draw()` method

```go
// In exploration mode, only show party leader and enemies/objects
if g.currentMode == ModeExploration {
    if entity.HasTag("player") {
        // Only show the party leader in exploration mode
        if entity != g.partyManager.GetPartyLeader() {
            continue // Skip non-leader party members
        }
    }
}
```

**Result**: 
- âœ… Only party leader visible in exploration mode
- âœ… All party members visible in tactical mode
- âœ… Enemies and objects always visible

## âœ… Issue 2: Fixed Grid Positioning in Tactical Mode

### Problem
Entities were positioned at the top of the screen because the tactical deployment system wasn't accounting for the grid rendering offset.

### Solution
**File**: `internal/engine/party_manager.go` - `DeployParty()` and `DeployEnemies()` methods

```go
// Update entity transform to match grid position with offset
if transform := member.Transform(); transform != nil {
    worldX, worldY := td.Grid.GridToWorld(gridPos)
    // Add the grid offset (same as used in DrawGrid)
    transform.X = worldX + 50.0
    transform.Y = worldY + 120.0
}
```

**Result**:
- âœ… Party members positioned on left side of tactical grid
- âœ… Enemies positioned on right side of tactical grid
- âœ… Entities align with visual grid overlay
- âœ… Organized formation deployment

## âœ… Issue 3: Added Tactical Input Handling

### Problem
No input handling for tactical mode - couldn't move players or switch between party members.

### Solution
**File**: `internal/engine/engine.go` - Enhanced `updateTactical()` method

#### Added Features:

**1. Player Switching (TAB Key)**
```go
// Handle TAB key for player switching in tactical mode
if ebiten.IsKeyPressed(ebiten.KeyTab) {
    if !g.tabKeyPressed {
        g.SwitchToNextTacticalPlayer()
        g.tabKeyPressed = true
    }
}
```

**2. Mouse Click Input**
```go
// Handle mouse input for tile selection and movement
if inpututil.IsMouseButtonJustPressed(ebiten.MouseButtonLeft) {
    x, y := ebiten.CursorPosition()
    screenX, screenY := float64(x), float64(y)
    offsetX, offsetY := 50.0, 120.0
    
    if gridPos, valid := g.tacticalManager.GetTileAtScreenPos(screenX, screenY, offsetX, offsetY); valid {
        g.handleTacticalClick(gridPos)
    }
}
```

**3. Arrow Key Movement**
```go
// Handle arrow keys for grid-based movement in tactical mode
activePlayer := g.GetActivePlayer()
if activePlayer != nil {
    g.handleTacticalArrowKeys(activePlayer)
}
```

### New Methods Added:

**1. `SwitchToNextTacticalPlayer()`**
- Cycles through party members in tactical mode only
- Updates active player index and UI messages
- Highlights movement range for newly selected player

**2. `handleTacticalClick(gridPos)`**
- Handles mouse clicks on grid tiles
- Selects tiles and units
- Initiates movement to clicked positions

**3. `handleTacticalArrowKeys(player)`** 
- Processes arrow key input for grid movement
- Uses `inpututil.IsKeyJustPressed()` for precise input
- Calculates grid positions and validates moves

**4. `tryMovePlayerToTile(player, gridPos)`**
- Validates movement to target position
- Updates grid occupancy state
- Moves player transform to new world coordinates
- Provides user feedback via UI messages

## Enhanced Active Player System

### Problem
`GetActivePlayer()` method didn't differentiate between exploration and tactical modes.

### Solution
**File**: `internal/engine/engine.go` - Updated `GetActivePlayer()` method

```go
func (g *Game) GetActivePlayer() *ecs.Entity {
    if g.currentMode == ModeExploration {
        // In exploration mode, always return the party leader
        return g.partyManager.GetPartyLeader()
    } else {
        // In tactical mode, return active party member
        partyMembers := g.partyManager.GetPartyForTactical()
        if len(partyMembers) == 0 {
            return nil
        }
        if g.activePlayerIndex >= len(partyMembers) {
            g.activePlayerIndex = 0
        }
        return partyMembers[g.activePlayerIndex]
    }
}
```

**Result**:
- âœ… Exploration mode: Always returns party leader
- âœ… Tactical mode: Returns currently active party member
- âœ… Proper player switching behavior in both modes

## How to Test the Fixes

### Exploration Mode Testing
1. **Single Leader Display**: Only one player character should be visible
2. **Leader Movement**: Arrow keys move only the party leader
3. **Enemy Collision**: Colliding with enemies triggers tactical mode

### Tactical Mode Testing
1. **Grid Positioning**: 
   - Party members appear on left side of grid
   - Enemies appear on right side of grid
   - All units align with grid overlay

2. **Player Control**:
   - **TAB Key**: Switch between party members
   - **Arrow Keys**: Move active player on grid
   - **Mouse Clicks**: Select tiles and move units
   - **ESC Key**: Return to exploration mode

3. **Movement Validation**:
   - Cannot move to occupied tiles
   - Cannot move outside grid boundaries
   - UI messages confirm successful moves

## Technical Implementation Details

### Grid Offset Handling
- **Grid Rendering Offset**: (50, 120) pixels
- **Entity Positioning**: Accounts for same offset
- **Mouse Input**: Correctly translates screen coordinates to grid positions

### Input System Integration
- **Added Import**: `github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2/inpututil`
- **Precise Input**: Uses `inpututil.IsKeyJustPressed()` and `inpututil.IsMouseButtonJustPressed()`
- **State Management**: Prevents key repeat issues with proper state tracking

### Grid State Management
- **Occupancy Tracking**: Grid tiles track which units occupy them
- **Collision Detection**: Prevents movement to occupied positions
- **State Synchronization**: Entity transforms stay synchronized with grid positions

## Compilation Status

âœ… **All code compiles successfully**
âœ… **No compilation errors**
âœ… **All imports resolved**
âœ… **Game builds and runs**

The graphics memory warnings (CAMetalLayer) are unrelated to our code and are common on macOS systems with certain graphics configurations.

## What You Can Now Do

### In Exploration Mode:
- Navigate with only the party leader visible
- Collide with enemies to enter tactical combat
- All other party members are managed in background

### In Tactical Mode:
- Use **TAB** to switch between your party members
- Use **Arrow Keys** to move the active party member on the grid
- **Click** on tiles to move or select
- Use **ESC** to return to exploration mode
- See your full party deployed against enemy groups

The party management system now works exactly as you requested: single leader exploration with full party tactical deployment! ðŸŽ¯âœ¨
