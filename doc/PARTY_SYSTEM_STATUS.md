# Party Management System - Implementation Status

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive party management system that transforms the exploration-tactical game mode as requested. The system supports:

- **Exploration Mode**: Single party leader represents entire team
- **Tactical Mode**: Full party deployment with organized grid positioning
- **Automatic Transition**: Collision-based switching from exploration to tactical combat

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Created

#### 1. PartyManager (`internal/engine/party_manager.go`)
```go
type PartyManager struct {
    PartyLeader    *ecs.Entity   // Single exploration representative
    PartyMembers   []*ecs.Entity // Full tactical party (max 6)
    ReserveMembers []*ecs.Entity // Inactive party members
    MaxPartySize   int           // Maximum party size
}
```

**Key Methods:**
- `SetPartyLeader(leader *ecs.Entity)` - Designates exploration leader
- `AddPartyMember(member *ecs.Entity)` - Adds member to tactical party
- `GetPartyForTactical()` - Returns full party for tactical deployment
- `UpdatePartyLeaderPosition(x, y float64)` - Tracks leader position

#### 2. EnemyGroupManager (`internal/engine/party_manager.go`)
```go
type EnemyGroupManager struct {
    GroupRange float64 // 150 pixel range for enemy group formation
}
```

**Key Methods:**
- `FormEnemyGroup(triggerEnemy, allEntities)` - Groups nearby enemies for tactical combat

#### 3. TacticalDeployment (`internal/engine/party_manager.go`)
```go
type TacticalDeployment struct {
    Grid         *tactical.Grid
    PlayerZone   DeploymentZone  // Left side deployment area
    EnemyZone    DeploymentZone  // Right side deployment area
}
```

**Key Methods:**
- `DeployParty(partyMembers []*ecs.Entity)` - Positions party on tactical grid
- `DeployEnemies(enemies []*ecs.Entity)` - Positions enemies on tactical grid

### Game Engine Integration

#### Updated `NewGame()` Function
- Initializes PartyManager with 6-member capacity
- Creates EnemyGroupManager with 150-pixel grouping range
- Sets up TacticalDeployment with grid integration

#### Enhanced `AddEntity()` Method
- Automatically adds player entities to party management
- Sets first player as party leader
- Maintains party composition as players are added

#### Modified `SwitchToTacticalMode()` Method
- Deploys full party instead of just exploration leader
- Forms enemy groups for tactical combat
- Positions all units on tactical grid using deployment zones

#### Updated Collision Detection
- Uses EnemyGroupManager to form enemy groups on collision
- Triggers tactical mode with full party vs enemy group
- Maintains exploration leader position tracking

## Game Flow

### Exploration Phase
1. **Single Leader Movement**: Only party leader visible and controllable
2. **Position Tracking**: PartyManager tracks leader position
3. **Collision Detection**: Monitors for enemy encounters
4. **Party Management**: Full party maintained in background

### Tactical Transition
1. **Collision Detection**: Party leader collides with enemy
2. **Enemy Group Formation**: EnemyGroupManager forms enemy group (150px range)
3. **Mode Switch**: Game switches to ModeTactical
4. **Full Deployment**: 
   - Party leader + all party members deployed to left side
   - Enemy group deployed to right side
   - Grid positioning handled automatically

### Tactical Phase
1. **Grid-Based Combat**: 20x15 tactical grid with 32px tiles
2. **Full Party Control**: All party members available
3. **Enemy Group Combat**: Face organized enemy formations
4. **Visual Grid**: Blue=movement, Red=attack, Yellow=selected, Green=path

## Technical Features

### Automatic Party Management
- Players added via `game.AddEntity()` automatically join party
- First player becomes exploration leader
- Party composition maintained throughout game

### Dynamic Enemy Grouping
- Enemies within 150 pixels form tactical groups
- Groups created dynamically on encounter
- Supports varied encounter sizes

### Organized Deployment
- **Player Zone**: Left side of tactical grid
- **Enemy Zone**: Right side of tactical grid
- **Grid Positioning**: Automatic positioning in organized formations
- **Transform Sync**: Entity positions updated to match grid positions

### Multi-Trigger System
- **Collision-Based**: Primary trigger (collision with enemies)
- **Manual T-Key**: Developer/testing trigger
- **Spacebar**: Smart trigger when enemies nearby

## Testing Status

### âœ… Completed
- **Compilation**: All code compiles without errors
- **Party Registration**: Players automatically added to party system
- **Party Leader Assignment**: First player becomes exploration leader
- **Enemy Group Formation**: Dynamic enemy grouping functional
- **Grid Deployment**: Tactical positioning system implemented
- **Mode Switching**: Exploration â†” Tactical transitions working

### ðŸ§ª Ready for Testing
- **Full Game Flow**: Exploration â†’ Collision â†’ Tactical deployment
- **Multi-Character Tactical**: Full party combat vs enemy groups
- **Grid Positioning**: Verify proper deployment zones
- **Animation Integration**: Ensure animations work in tactical mode

## Next Development Steps

### Phase 2 Priorities (Per Roadmap)
1. **Movement Range Calculation**: Implement character stat-based movement
2. **Mouse Controls**: Click-to-move tactical interface
3. **Pathfinding**: A* pathfinding with movement costs
4. **Movement Highlighting**: Visual indication of valid movement tiles

### Integration Testing
1. **End-to-End Flow**: Complete exploration â†’ tactical â†’ resolution cycle
2. **Performance Testing**: Multiple enemy groups and large parties
3. **Save/Load Integration**: Persist party composition across sessions

## Architecture Benefits

### Clean Separation
- **Exploration Logic**: Minimal overhead, single character focus
- **Tactical Logic**: Full complexity when needed
- **Automatic Transition**: Seamless user experience

### Scalable Design
- **Party Size**: Configurable maximum party size
- **Enemy Groups**: Dynamic group formation
- **Grid Size**: Tactical grid easily configurable
- **Deployment Zones**: Flexible positioning system

### User Experience
- **Simple Exploration**: Navigate with single character
- **Rich Tactical**: Full party strategy when encountering enemies
- **Automatic Flow**: No manual mode switching required
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear grid overlay and unit positioning

## Conclusion

The party management system successfully implements the requested "exploration with single party leader â†’ full tactical team deployment" workflow. The system provides:

1. **Streamlined Exploration**: Single character navigation
2. **Rich Tactical Combat**: Full party vs enemy group encounters
3. **Automatic Transitions**: Collision-based mode switching
4. **Organized Deployment**: Proper grid positioning for tactical combat
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Support for varied party and enemy group sizes

The implementation is complete and ready for testing, with a clear path forward for Phase 2 enhancements.
